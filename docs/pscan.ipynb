However, as you can see, I chose to followed a more algorithm-friendly approach and keep this math-friendly approach for the proof. Blelloch follows the principle of an exclusive scan, while here, it is an inclusive scan that is presented (the cumulative sum take into account only elements that are strictly before it)"
